# CubismZ: A Parallel Data Compression Framework for Large Scale 3D Scientific Data


## Software design

CubismZ performs two compression stages on the input dataset.  The first stage
makes use of (lossy) floating point compression algorithms.  In the second
stage, general-purpose lossless methods are applied to the compressed data of
the first stage.  A more detailed description can be found in the paper.

#### Substage 1: Floating point compression

Available compressors for this stage are:

- 3D wavelets ([CSELAB][linklab])
- FPZIP ([LLNL][linkllnl])
- ZFP ([LLNL][linkllnl])
- SZ ([ANL][linkanl])

#### Substage 2: General-purpose lossless compression

Available compression techniques for this stage are:

- [ZLIB][linkzlib]
- [LZ4][linklz4]

Before lossless compression, data (byte) shuffling and bit zeroing can be optionally applied to the output of the wavelet-based compression scheme.

#### External software dependencies

- MPI library (Tested platforms: MPICH, OpenMPI, MVAPICH2)
- Parallel HDF5 (Compatible with one of the above MPI libraries)

## Quick start

#### 1. Make sure that the prerequisite libraries are available

- MPI library
- Parallel HDF5 library 

#### 2. Configure the software

- Edit `CubismZ/Makefile` and set the following options 
   - `MPICC`, `mpicc`: MPI-aware C++ and C compiler, respectively
   - `hdf-inc`, `hdf-lib`, `hdf-library`: location and name of the parallel HDF5 library 

#### 3. Build the CubismZ tools

- Issue `make` within the `CubismZ` directory. This will
  - configure and build the third-party libraries and install them into the `CubismZ/ThirdParty/build` directory. 
  - build the CubismZ tools (`hdf2cz`, `cz2hdf`, `cz2diff`) for each of the basic configurations and put the executable into the corresponding subdirectories of the `CubimZ/Tools/bin` directory. 

#### 4. Run the demo tests

- Enter the `Tests/Test1` directory and execute the script `./run_all.sh`. 

  - The generated `run_all.txt` file contains the output for the main configurations of the compression tools, running them 
    on a single core (`mpirun -n 1` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`).
  - The reported compression ratios and PSNR values must coincide with those reported in the reference output file `cselab_ref_run_all.txt`.
  - The `run_all.sh` script uses the `mpirun` command to launch the executable.
    Some systems might offer a different command for launching MPI applications (e.g. `srun` for SLURM).

- Enter the `Tests/Test2` directory and execute the script `./run_all.sh`. 

  - This test uses the wavelet-based scheme to first compress the `demo.h5` HDF5 file and then decompress the output compressed file 
    (`tmp.cz`) and converts it back to the HDF5 format (`out.h5` and `out.xmf`). 
  - The two HDF5 files must have the same file size and if visualized with Paraview they depict almost identical images.

## Detailed compilation instructions


### Configured compilation

The default set of executables required to reproduce the included test cases
can be generated by invoking `make` in the root directory.

The `C++` and `C` MPI wrappers can be set using the `MPICC` and `mpicc` flags, respectively.
They default to `MPICC=mpic++` and `mpicc=mpicc`. 

The software has been tested with the [GCC][gcclink], [Intel][intellink] and [Clang][clanglink] compilers.

OpenMP is enabled by default, except for the Clang compiler.  It can be enabled
for a Clang installation that supports OpenMP by passing `extra=-fopenmp` to
the `make` command.

In order to compile the software, a parallel build of the [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org) library is required.
The path to the HDF5 `include` and `lib` directories can be specified using the `hdf-inc` and
`hdf-lib` variables respectively.  See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for
further details.

Successful execution of the build chain generates a set of executables in the `CubismZ/Tools/bin` directory.
The configuration for these binaries is as follows:

##### No compression (default)

Conversion to the CZ format without data compression.  No special flags are
required for this build at compile time.  This target can be built individually
inside the `CubismZ/Tools` directory with:
```
make
```

##### Wavelets and ZLIB

Generates a build using the CubismZ wavelet compression scheme for the first
compression stage (floating point compression) and applies [ZLIB][linkzlib] in
the second compression stage.  This target can be built individually inside the
`CubismZ/Tools` directory with:
```
make wavz=1 zlib=1
```

##### ZFP

Generates a build using the [ZFP][linkllnl] floating point compressor for the
first compression stage.  No further compression is applied for the second
stage.  This target can be built individually inside the `CubismZ/Tools` directory
with:
```
make zfp=1
```

##### FPZIP

Generates a build using the [FPZIP][linkllnl] floating point compressor for the
first compression stage.  No further compression is applied for the second
stage.  This target can be built individually inside the `CubismZ/Tools` directory
with:
```
make fpzip=1
```

##### SZ

Generates a build using the [SZ][linkanl] floating point compressor for the
first compression stage.  No further compression is applied for the second
stage.  This target can be built individually inside the `CubismZ/Tools` directory
with:
```
make sz=1
```


### Custom compilation

Custom user defined configurations are possible as well.  Any of the
combinations described in the [design](#design) section are possible.  Custom
builds are generated with the `tools-custom` rule defined in the
`CubismZ/Makefile`.  The following illustrates two examples how to compile a
custom build.  The `dir=` option sets the name of the directory in `Tools/bin`.
If it exists, its content will be overwritten.  The default is `dir=default`.

##### Wavelets, shuffling and ZLIB
```
make tools-custom dir=mycustom1 wavz=1 shuffle3=1 zlib=1
```

##### Wavelets and LZ4
```
make tools-custom dir=mycustom2 wavz=1 lz4=1
```

Additional compile time flags may be required for compiler specification and
HDF5 library paths.  See the [configured compilation](#configured-compilation)
section for more details.


##### Blocksize

The block dimension can be specified at compile time.  The default value is
`blocksize=32`, which translates to cubic blocks with `32 * 32 * 32` data
elements.  The `blocksize` argument can be passed to the make command.  Its
value must be a power of two.


## Runtime arguments of CubismZ tools for HDF5 datasets

### 1. The `hdf2cz` tool

Compression of HDF5 files to CZ format.
```
hdf2cz -bpdx <nbx> -bpdy <nby> -bpdz <nbz> -h5file <hdf5 file> -czfile <cz file> -threshold <e> [-wtype <wt>]
```

- The HDF5 file consists of `nbx * nby * nbz` 3D blocks
- The input HDF5 file is compressed and stored to `<cz file>`
- The `threshold` parameter specifies how lossy the compression will be and depends on the lossy floating compressor used at the first substage of CubismZ. More specically:
  - **Wavelets**: wavelets coefficients with *absolute value* smaller than the threshold are decimated.
  - **FPZIP**: `threshold` denotes the number of useful bits of the floating point numbers (e.g. it must be equal to 32 for full accuracy of single precision datasets)
  - **ZFP**: `threshold` specifies to the *absolute error* tolerance for fixed-accuracy mode.
  - **SZ**: the (de)compression errors is limited to be within an *absolute error* defined by `threshold`
- The wavelet type can optionally be specified using the `-wtype` option.
  The following options for wavelet types are supported
  - **1**: 4th order interpolating wavelets
  - **2**: 4th order lifted interpolating wavelets
  - **3**: 3rd order average interpolating wavelets (default)


##### MPI-enabled data compression 
```
hdf2cz  [-xpesize <npx> -ypesize <npy> -zpesize <npz>] -bpdx <nbx> -bpdy <nby> -bpdz <nbz> 
```


### 2. The `ch2hdf` tool

Decompression of CZ files and conversion to HDF5 format
```
cz2hdf -czfile <cz file> -h5file <h5 file> [-wtype <wt>]
```

- The output file can be visualized with ParaView
- Compile time options (`blocksize`, compression scheme) must agree with those
  used for the compression phase.  See the [blocksize](#blocksize) section for
  more information.
- The optional parameter specified by `wtype` must agree with the type of wavelets
  used in the compressed file.


### 3. The `cz2diff` tool

Decompress and compare two CZ files
```
cz2diff -czfile1 <cz file1> [-wtype <wt>] -czfile2 <cz reference file2>
```

- The second CZ file is used as the reference dataset and must have been generated
  by the default configuration of the `hdf2cz` tool, i.e., without any
  [compression method enabled](#no-compression-default)
- Useful for quality assessment of the compression


## Example: Fluid dynamics data

#### Demo dataset

The software release includes a set of basic tests to demonstrate the
capabilities of the CubismZ compression techniques. The demo dataset (`demo.h5`) 
consists of the spherical bubble located at the center of the cubic domain
and discretized with `128 * 128 * 128` cells. 
The HDF5 file (8MB) is available in the `CubismZ/Tests/Data` directory.
A visualization of the single bubble is depicted below.

![](.images/demo.png)


#### Compression performance tests

The compression performance tests are located in `CubismZ/Tests/Test1`.  The test
scripts require the simulation HDF5 data `demo.h5`, which is located in `CubismZ/Tests/Data`.

The complete test chain can be run by executing `CubismZ/Tests/Test1/run_all.sh`.  The
script requires that the [configured compilation](#configured-compilation) has
been performed previously.  The `run_all.sh` script generates a `run_all.txt`
file with the output of the compressor test configurations.
The script can be run with the syntax:
```
./run_all.sh [<n processors>]
```
where `<n processors>` is the number of MPI processes to be used.  The default
is 1.  Reference output from [CSELAB][linklab] can be found in
`cselab_ref_run_all.txt`.  The script executes the following tasks:

1. `genref.sh`: Generates a reference CZ file without compression, based on
   the HDF5 input data.  The script can also be executed individually with the
   syntax:
   ```
   ./genref.sh
   ```

2. `test_wavz.sh`: Runs the [wavelets and zlib](#wavelets-and-zlib) compressor.
   If no reference file exists, the script will generate it automatically.  The
   test can be run individually with the syntax:
   ```
   ./test_wavz.sh [<n processors> [<error threshold>]]
   ```
   Parameter in square brackets are optional. `<n processors>` sets the number
   of MPI processes.  Defaults to 1 if not specified.  The `<error threshold>`
   parameter is specific to the wavelet compressor.  The default is 0.01.

3. `test_zfp.sh`: Runs the [ZFP](#zfp) compressor.  If no reference file
   exists, the script will generate it automatically.  The test can be run
   individually with the syntax:
   ```
   ./test_zfp.sh [<n processors> [<error threshold>]]
   ```
   Parameter in square brackets are optional. `<n processors>` sets the number
   of MPI processes.  Defaults to 1 if not specified.  The `<error threshold>`
   parameter is specific to the ZFP compressor.  The default is 0.5.

4. `test_fpzip.sh`: Runs the [FPZIP](#fpzip) compressor.  If no reference file
   exists, the script will generate it automatically.  The test can be run
   individually with the syntax:
   ```
   ./test_fpzip.sh [<n processors> [<n bits>]]
   ```
   Parameter in square brackets are optional. `<n processors>` sets the number
   of MPI processes.  Defaults to 1 if not specified.  The `<n bits>`
   parameter is specific to the FPZIP compressor.  The default is 22.

5. `test_sz.sh`: Runs the [SZ](#sz) compressor.  If no reference file exists,
   the script will generate it automatically.  The test can be run individually
   with the syntax:
   ```
   ./test_sz.sh [<n processors> [<error threshold>]]
   ```
   Parameter in square brackets are optional. `<n processors>` sets the number
   of MPI processes.  Defaults to 1 if not specified.  The `<error threshold>`
   parameter is specific to the SZ compressor.  The default is 0.01.  The SZ
   compressor can be further configured using the provided
   `CubismZ/Tests/Test1/sz.config` file.

The performance metrics (compression ratio, errors, PSNR value) are written to
the standard output or into the file `run_all.txt` if the batch script is used.
The PSNR value is computed based on the reference CZ file generated with the
`genref.sh` script.


##### Testing custom builds

Custom builds can be tested against the reference using the `test_custom.sh`
script.  The execution syntax for this script is:
```
./test_custom.sh <path to binaries> <error threshold> [<n processors>]
```
where

* `<path to binaries>`: Path to the directory that contains the custom build.
  For example, if `dir=mycustom` has been passed to the `make` command, the
  path is `../../Tools/bin/mycustom` (assuming the current working directory is
  `CubismZ/Tests/Test1`.

* `<error threshold>`: Error threshold that corresponds to the chosen floating
  point compressor (substage1 compressor).

* `<n processors>`: Number of MPI processes to be used.  Optional, defaults to 1.

#### Visual assessment for lossy compressors

An example of compression and decompression cycle is provided in `CubismZ/Tests/Test2`.
The `run_all.sh` script can be executed to run the test chain.
The script can be run with the syntax:
```
./run_all.sh [<n processors>]
```
where `<n processors>` is the number of MPI processes to be used.  The default
is 1.  The input HDF5 data is compressed to the CZ format using the `hdf2cz`
tool with wavelets and ZLIB compression substages.  The compressed data is then
converted back to HDF5 using the `cz2hdf` tool and can be used for
visualization using a capable tool such as ParaView, for example.

#### Cloud caviation collapse dataset

The software release includes an additional dataset that can be optionally used 
for testing the compression capabilities of CubismZ.  The test data consists of
the 3D pressure field of a cloud cavitation collapse simulation.  The initial
configuration is composed of 70 air bubbles (dispersed phase, non-condensible
gas) submerged in liquid water (continuous phase) and is discretized in a cubic
domain with `512 * 512 * 512` cells.  Note that the simulation is
under-resolved.  Nevertheless, the degree of variation in the quantity of
interest (3D pressure field) is sufficient to test the compression algorithms.
The snapshot of the test data is taken at iteration 5000.  A visualization of
the gas volume fraction as well as the pressure in a plane through the cloud
center for this iteration is shown below.

![](.images/pressure_alpha2_5000.png)

Additionally, the mean pressure over all iteration steps is shown in the next
figure.  Plus/minus one standard deviation is indicated by the shaded region.

![](.images/mean_pressure.png)

The pressure test data at iteration 5000 can be downloaded at the following
link (512MB):

[data_005000-p.h5][datadl]

The file must be placed in the `CubismZ/Tests/Data` directory. 
The corresponding tests are located in the `CubismZ/Tests/Test1_cav` and 
`CubismZ/Tests/Test2_cav` directories. 

  
#### 5. Run the cavitation data tests (optional)

- Download the cavitation dataset into the `CubismZ/Tests/Test1` directory.
- Enter the `CubismZ/Tests/Test1_cav` directory and execute the script `run_all.sh`. 
- Enter the `CubismZ/Tests/Test2_cav` directory and execute the script `run_all.sh`.
